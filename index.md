## Welcome to Jiaying's Homepage!

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by Prof. [Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/). Starting soon, I will be joining [NUS Centre for Trusted Internet and Community](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) as a postdoctoral research fellow, working with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) and affiliated with [NUS Web IR / NLP Group (WING)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). 


## Research Interests

My research interests are at the intersection of natural language processing and data mining, with a focus on:
- **Misinformation and Disinformation:** detection and governance of misleading, false or manipulated content.
- **Scientific Document Processing:** enhancing scientific discovery and communication.
