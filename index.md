## Welcome to Jiaying's Homepage!

I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Centre for Trusted Internet and Community (CTIC)](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), working with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) and affiliated with [NUS Web IR / NLP Group (WING)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at NUS in 2024, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/). 


## Research Interests

My research interests are at the intersection of natural language processing and data mining, with a focus on:
- **Misinformation and Disinformation:** Detection and governance of misleading, false or manipulated content. (e.g., [CrowdNotes+](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11423), [IMOL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1494.pdf), [SheepDog](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3637528.3671977), [DECOR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3580305.3599298))
- **Advancing Scientific Discovery & Communication:** Leveraging LLMs to accelerate knowledge discovery and bridge the gap between scientific findings and public understanding. (e.g., [MLR-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19955), [CCSBench](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12601))
- **LLM Reasoning & Trustworthiness:** Advancing the reasoning capabilities, reliability, and transparency of LLMs in real-world decision-making contexts. (e.g., [ConfTuner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18847), [Awesome-Efficient-Inference-for-LRMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23077), [JudgeLRM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00050), [ProCal](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/d826f5aadb26db488b8686097ceea2d1-Paper-Conference.pdf))

<font color="red">I am currently on the job market, seeking research opportunities in both academia and industry (including postdoc positions) starting in 2026, and always open to collaborations. Feel free to get in touch by email.</font>

## Misc.
With a B.Eng. in Computer Science and a Double Degree (B.A.) in English from [Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU)](https://en.bfsu.edu.cn/) (2016–2020), my years there sparked a lasting love for language. During this time, I became a [CATTI-certified](https://www.catticenter.com/wzjs/452) English–Chinese translator (Level 2) and interpreter (Level 3), and contributed to the English-to-Chinese translation of four books and one book series, all published in China. These experiences continue to shape how I think about communication and meaning.
