## Welcome to Jiaying's Homepage!

I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Centre for Trusted Internet and Community](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), working with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) and affiliated with [NUS Web IR / NLP Group (WING)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at NUS in 2024, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/). 


## Research Interests

My research interests are at the intersection of natural language processing and data mining, with a focus on:
- **Misinformation and Disinformation:** Detection and governance of misleading, false or manipulated content. (e.g., [CrowdNotes+](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11423), [IMOL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1494.pdf), [SheepDog](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3637528.3671977), [DECOR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3580305.3599298))
- **LLMs for Scientific Discovery & Communication:** Leveraging LLMs to accelerate knowledge discovery and bridge the gap between scientific findings and public understanding. (e.g., [MLR-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19955), [CCSBench](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12601))
- **LLMs Reasoning & Trustworthiness:** Advancing the reasoning capabilities, reliability, and transparency of LLMs in real-world decision-making contexts. (e.g., [ConfTuner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18847), [Awesome-Efficient-Inference-for-LRMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23077), [JudgeLRM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00050), [PROCAL](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/d826f5aadb26db488b8686097ceea2d1-Paper-Conference.pdf))

## Misc.
With a B.Eng. in Computer Science and a Double Degree (B.A.) in English from [Beijing Foreign Studies University](https://en.bfsu.edu.cn/) (2016–2020), my years there sparked a lasting love for language. During this time, I became a [CATTI-certified](https://www.catticenter.com/wzjs/452) Chinese↔English translator (Level 2) and interpreter (Level 3), and contributed to the English-to-Chinese translation of four books and one book series, all published in China. These experiences continue to shape how I think about communication and meaning.
