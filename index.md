## Welcome to Jiaying's Homepage!

I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Centre for Trusted Internet and Community](https://ctic.nus.edu.sg/) at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), working with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) and affiliated with [NUS Web IR / NLP Group (WING)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at NUS in 2024, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/). 


## Research Interests

My research interests are at the intersection of natural language processing and data mining, with a focus on:
